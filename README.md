# Working with the LED on the Raspberry Pi 4

Used Python for the proramming language to write the firmware. Python is a great language to use, however there is a fork from the main language called "MicroPython" which is specific to embedded devices.  The goal is to learn how to work with ARM embedded devices and move away from AVR.

# libraries

pip install RPi.GPIO 0.7.1
* not recommended when using in production for scheduling or timing critical applications.


- the goal of the program is to have an embedded system that will allow the push of a button to control the LED

- the goal of the blinkpi.py program was to create a program that will blink the led using python
